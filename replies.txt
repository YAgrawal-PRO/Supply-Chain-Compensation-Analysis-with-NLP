Sr Planning Manager / professional cat herder, $155k base, maybe $170k USD with bonus, profit sharing etc. Cannabis industry and fully remote. 13 years experience (7 of which was fully in office).
I’m actually in a super similar boat to you. 138k base, roughly will be $190k with bonus as sr. Planning manager. Glad to hear my compensation is competitive lol.
Physical locations aren't mentioned, so it's hard to know.
I’m pretty similar, Manager in our Consolidation division. $125k base, 20-30% bonus
13 years in that industry or supply chain?
13 years in planning, five and a half at a retailer. Five years and half or so in cpg wholesale planning. Two years and change of beauty industry wholesale planning.
And now I forecast nugget consumption.
Wow these are some crazy high salaries I’m not even close to
The issue with ”polls” like this is that average people rarely answers. So the top earners are keen to answer which skews the distribution of answers.
Few people will bother answering this post if they earn a low or medium salary whereas the top earners are more prone to share their good salary.
This is like asking people how much you lift online ... There's no fucking way. Or I'm coping.
The distribution is very skewed in ”polls” like this.
The average earners will not answer
Move to west coast, you'll see it's really not far-fetched at all.
I recently made $25 an hour as a supply coordinator with no benefits 😂
That is like slightly more than an entry level Amazon warehouse position at least where I'm at.
Supply Chain Director $175k TC MCOL area
Sr transportation planner - 88k - Chicago
I live with my girlfriend who makes around 60k a year and we live pretty decent. Able to save about 1-1.3k a month. However I agree it's not enough but if you look at jobs around here I'm on the higher end of the pay scale. Im working to get a manager role which would put me over 100k.
I have around 9 years experience in transportation, which I feel gets paid less than your supply chain roles.
Regional Logistician - $112k - TX
Have an upvote for the use of “Logistician.” 😋
Lol thank you. Its the best way to describe the all-encompassing role
Hahaha same. When they ask what it means, I say "I move boxes" which gets on her nervse or I say "I move product" which results in a disapproving sigh.
“I make sure the boxes get from A to B” 😆📦🚛
$34/hr Project Management intern. Graduate in December with bachelors in OSCM.
Tips on getting such an internship?
I applied a few 100 during fall of junior year and got one with an aerospace company. The key is to mass apply when recs come out. Once I got the first internship I was able to apply internally and got a co op which I’m in right now. I also go to a pretty unknown state school so you may have a higher or lower success rate than me depending on experience and school.
I live in Europe and I make 60 k plus bonus 9% and welfare as a supply chain planning specialist so I am shocked by these replies, because my salary is quite high in my country. Probably different cost of living, different welfare etc?
US salaries are different. Impossible to compare.
Ask them about their vacations this year and how much of the high salary is left over at the end of the year and compare that. The US is in a death spiral of rising cost -> rising pay -> rising cost. All while removing any safety net once something bad happens
Even in EU going on vacation has become a nightmare tbh, Raising costs everywhere. Shiiiit
Europe vs. US salaries are basically impossible to compare. For instance, over here, we might earn a higher wage, but (speaking only for my family), immediately we have to assume at least $8-12k might go toward health insurance premiums. So right there you're down 10-15% depending on your starting wage (sometimes more). We don't have things like a PAYE system, so our taxes are all kinds of weird.
Typically a 38-60k salary in Europe is equivalent to 65-100+k in the US between exchange rates and differing tax structures + benefits, etc.
Thanks for the insight !
I’m in Aus, I make about $120k with about 10% bonus as a Senior Demand Planner. It’s a pretty good salary for where I am but these US salaries have me shocked.
They have to make up for healthcare and no vacations basically? i have 8 wks PTO every year plus free healthcare of course in EU .. so I mean I guess salary alone is not indicative, but comparable if only US replies
Even 3500 $ a year in healthcare would still be a lot for me but I guess that is my point also, cost of living and salaries are proportionate.
The maximum out of pocket I pay for the year on high deductible healthcare plan is $3,500. That’s my total responsibility. So yeah, an ambulance may cost $500 but once I hit $3,500 I’m not paying anything. I’m relatively young, could pay ~$100 a month for like a $1,500 out of pocket max. Because it’s HDHCP I am eligible for an HSA in which my company matches about $1,000 and I max it out (tax free) for whatever the number is each year. I think health insurance in America is bullshit, but it’s not as bad as some people make out. There are horror stories of where you hear about people paying $1,200 a month, but I don’t think that’s the norm. The fact that it’s a for profit business is what’s terrible. American’s also carry the most consumer debt in the world. People just don’t save for emergencies, that’s where things get tough. Always two sides to the story.

Also have unlimited PTO that company really does encourage us to use. 😊
Looking for recent college grads 👀👀
Entry-level supply chain analysts usually start around $55-70k, depending on location, industry, and whether it’s manufacturing, logistics, or retail. Once you get a few years in, roles like demand planner or operations coordinator can hit the 80-100k range.
Focus on learning Excel, SQL, and basic forecasting. Those skills bump your value quickly.
I feel poor all of a sudden while reading the comments….
Ops Manager - 75k first year at the company but they typically give 8-10 percent raises
Not bad at all for me WLB wise. I work my 8 hours and go home. I stay an extra hour maybe once a week and that’s by my own choice because i’ll wait last minute to do things😂
Just to add my company is mid sized does about 100Ms a year and is still ran by the family who built it so its alot different then amazon or a huge retailer, I was previously at walmart
Production planner -78K automotive
Logistics analyst - $73k automotive.

Seeing this thread can really make your realize 2 big things, the same title can mean vastly different responsibilities and different companies value supply chain at crazy different levels.
